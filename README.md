# PostgreSQL Database Connection with Jupyter Notebook - Basic Queries

This repository contains a video demonstration where I connected a PostgreSQL database with Jupyter Notebook and executed several SQL queries using various statements to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data.

## Video Overview

In this video, I showcase the process of connecting a PostgreSQL database to Jupyter Notebook and demonstrate the execution of basic SQL queries. The video covers the following SQL statements and functionalities:

- **SELECT:** Retrieving specific columns or expressions from tables.
- **FROM:** Specifying the source tables for data retrieval.
- **WHERE:** Filtering data based on specified conditions.
- **AND:** Combining multiple conditions in a query.
- **LIMIT:** Limiting the number of rows returned by a query.
- **MAX:** Obtaining the maximum value from a column.
- **SUM:** Calculating the sum of values in a column.
- **AVG:** Computing the average value of a column.
- **DISTINCT:** Retrieving unique values from a column.
- **LIKE:** Searching for patterns in text columns.
- **COUNT:** Counting the number of rows or non-null values.
- **ORDER BY:** Sorting query results in ascending or descending order.
- **IN:** Filtering data by multiple possible values.
- **GROUP BY:** Grouping data based on specified columns.
- **HAVING:** Applying conditions to grouped data.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:
  **mp4.file**

## Usage

To explore the video demonstration:
1. Access the Jupyter Notebook file (`your_notebook.ipynb`) in the repository.
2. Execute the code cells to observe the process of connecting to the PostgreSQL database and running SQL queries.
